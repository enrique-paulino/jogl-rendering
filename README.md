# JOGL Rendering Project

## Overview
This coursework project was undertaken as part of the Graphics module at university. It centers around the development of a fundamental renderer and the incorporation of advanced features, utilising Java OpenGL (JOGL). 

## Task 1: Basic Renderer
### Interactive Transformations
The first part of this task, I was tasked with incorporating key-controlled transformations for the object displayed in the renderer, including:
- **Scale** - Adjusted using N (to shrink) and M (to expand)
- **Translation** - Controlled by arrow keys
- **Rotation** - Controlled by Y (clockwise) and U (anti-clockwise)

### Modelling and Lighting
The second part of this task, I had to create a cone object entirely from the ground up. This involved defining the vertices, normals, textures, and indices for the cone, as well as ensuring that it seamlessly integrated with interactive transformations, allowing for a comprehensive view of the cone from all angles.

### Texture Mapping
In final part of this task, I had to implement texture mapping for a cube, including setting up the texture coordinates and shaders properly. The process focused on making sure the textures wouldn't be stretched or improperly coloured, as well as setting up the environment with correct lighting. 

## Task 2: Advanced Features
### Bump Mapping
In the second task of this coursework, we had to choose from a list of advanced features, I chose to create a scene with more than one object with different textures, as well as applying bump mapping to one of the objects. The process focused on getting different textures for each of the objects, and then applying the bump mapping to only one of them; I also explored tangent space calculations so I could have correct lighting in order to enhance the 3D appearance of the bump mapping effect. Below you can see an image that shows the final product of this task:
